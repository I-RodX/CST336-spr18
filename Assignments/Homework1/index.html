                <h2><strong>What is Computer Malware?</strong></h2>
               <p> Malware, short for "malicious software", is a software designed with the intent to harm<br>
                   or gain access to a computer without the knowledge. The terms malware and virus are often<br>
                   confused because the first generation of malware were viruses which computer security<br>
                   companies marketed heavily in there name at the time and haven't changed since.

                <h2><strong>Why should you care?</strong></h2>
                <p> Malware deployment has advanced beyond the days of the floppy disk. With today's tech<br>
                    a simple email, advertisement, usb drive, etc can compromise a machine. The cost of<br>
                    allowing that compromise to happen is far more risky than corrupting the Operating<br>
                    System or intalling potentially unwanted programs. Malware now has been programmed<br>
                    to spy for personal data, hold data for ransom, enslave multiple systems to use them<br> 
                    for malicious activities and distrupt services public and private on a global scale.</p>
